## üõ† Build setup
Clone or fork this repository then download it, then run this command to start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Make changes in components and markdown files and see them reflected live in your website.

To generate a full static site, run

```
npm run generate
```

This will generate the static site in the `dist/` directory

### Pages
Any markdown file in the `content/` folder directory will create a new page. For example, try creating the page `privacy-policy.md` with the following content:

```
---
title: Privacy policy
description: How our services value your privacy
---

This is the privacy policy for my company.
```

Save the file, and head over to [localhost:3000/privacy-policy](http://localhost:3000/privacy-policy) to view the page.

### Hosting
Statically generate the site by running

```
npm run generate
```

This will create a `dist/` folder with the site. I decided to host the site using [Surge.sh](surge.sh). Install surge with 

```
npm install --global surge
```

(Mac users may have to run `sudo npm install --global surge`)


To host the `dist/` folder, run


```
surge dist
```

If you haven't yet created an account, the CLI will guide you through the steps. You can choose a custom `*.surge.sh` domain.
